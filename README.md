# What is this?
Welcome, this is my personal Neovim config. It is specifically tooled for typescript development, React Native in particular. Also has good Markdown support for using with Obsidian vaults.
## Future plans
I have a number of things I would like to work on going foward, most notably and lowest priority being a React Native DAP implementation. More likely short-term adds would be setting up Godot and Playdate support for hobby game development.
